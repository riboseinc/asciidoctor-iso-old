= Authoring ISO Standards in AsciiDoc

`asciidoctor-iso` is asciidoctor-based workflow that can create new ISO
standard documents in HTML and PDF formats.


== Formats

The format of an ISO standard document is defined by
http://www.iec.ch/members_experts/refdocs/iec/isoiecdir-2%7Bed7.0%7Den.pdf["ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2016"].

There are mainly 2 types of ISO standard documents:

1. "International Standard document"
2. "International Standard Amendment document"

These document types follow these templates / examples.


=== International Standard document

* http://www.iso.org/iso/model_document-rice_model.pdf["Model document of an International Standard - Rice model"]
* Word `.DOC` template provided at https://www.iso.org/drafting-standards.html["Drafting Standards > Simple template"]


=== International Standard Amendment document

* http://www.iso.org/iso/rice_model_amendment.pdf["Model document of an Amendment - Rice model amendment"]


== TODOs

Particular areas that need implementation are (refer to <<Formats>> for details):

* Title and metadata (e.g., ISO document number, which workgroup, edition and date)
* Copyright notice
* TOC
* Section numbering
* List numbering
* Citations and Bibliography formatting
* Headers and Footers
* Annex
* Self-references

== HTML And PDF

This gem has two parts:

* HTML

** contains necessary commands to create the HTML version
** contains the stylesheet to generate the HTML version

* PDF: maybe create a new gem called `asciidoctor-pdf-iso`

** creates the PDF version in the ISO format
** contains the stylesheet to generate the PDF version in ISO format

* Create the example templates in corresponding AsciiDoc format:

** Rice model Standard document
** Rice model Standard Amendment document
